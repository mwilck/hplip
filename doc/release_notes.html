<p><strong>HPLIP 0.9.8 - This release has the following changes:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Added PC send fax support. This feature is is supported by a send fax UI (hp-sendfax), send fax setup in the hp-toolbox (HP Device Manager), and a fax address book (hp-fab). Files (and an optional coverpage) may be sent by running the send fax UI directly or by printing through the supplied HP Fax CUPS backend from any application or by using lp/lpr. A CUPS queue configured with the HP Fax CUPS backend (hpfax:) must be separately set up for faxing to operate.</li>
<li>Added HP Setup utility. This new utility (hp-setup) can quickly and automatically setup print and/or fax queues for HPLIP supported devices. It will automatically choose the closest matching PPD file, print a testpage, and set up a fax queue and allow the user to perform basic fax setup (TTI header setup) if appropriate. Using the -m parameter, hp-setup also replaces the functionality of 'hp-makeuri'.</li>

<li>Fixed hp-makeuri quiet modes that they are actually quiet (no banner, etc).</li>
<li>Added a new chooser dialog that presents a list of CUPS queues rather than device URIs (switched hp-sendfax and hp-print over to new dialog).</li>
<li>Fixed a hpiod problem with the PS 2570 series. This will fix the scanning blue-screen error with USB High Speed.</li>

<p>KRGB definition:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
1. K=1-bit black plane, RGB=24 bit color raster.
2. K-plane will only contain objects that are black text and black line drawings.
3. RGB raster will not contain K-plane objects.

4. K resolution and RGB resolution will be equal.
5. K-plane will be byte aligned.
6. K-plane bit definition; 1=black, 0=nothing.
</pre>
<p>KRGB requires Ghostscript suppport. Current versions of Ghostscript do not support KRGB. In order to support KRGB, a Ghostscript KRGB patch is included in the HPIJS package. The patch modifies the IJS client in Ghostscript and is free to use under the MIT license. The new IJS client should be backward compatible with existing IJS servers. This means KRGB support is optional.</p>
<p>Use the following command in the Ghostscript source directory to apply the KRGB patch, then rebuild Ghostscript.</p>
