<h1 class="title">Frequently Asked Questions (with Answers!)</h1>
<p>This page is dedicated to listing the frequently asked questions (FAQs). This page will be updated as new questions and issues arise.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Help I can't find my printer in the supported printers list!</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Please check the <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/combined.html">All Supported Devices</a> list before submitting your question fo the mailing list.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question: My printer is unsupported, when will it be supported?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Most newer models are supported 2-3 weeks after the public release, sometimes even before that.  Some older models that are not supported are being researched for possible support in the future, although this may or may not happen depending on the printer and technical details involved.</li>
<li>Some printers are unsupported and will most likely stay unsupported. The reasons for this may include issues with intellectual property, technical issues, or limited production numbers. Be advised that printers that appear on the <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/unsupported.html">unsupported list</a> may never be supported by HPLIP.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question: What is included with HPLIP?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>HPLIP is a complete imaging and printing system for CUPS that includes HPIJS.</li>
<li>HPIJS is the basic printing driver that supports printing from CUPS, LPD, PPR, and other spoolers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question: How are HPLIP and HPIJS related?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: HPIJS is a subcomponent of HPLIP. HPIJS provides basic printing support for non-postscript printers. HPIJS can operate in any spooler environment (including no spooler). HPIJS provides no I/O. HPLIP provides I/O for bi-directional communication, scanning, photo card access, and toolbox functionality. HPLIP requires the CUPS spooler.</p>
<p><strong>Question: When would I want to use HPIJS instead of HPLIP?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: There are several possible reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On a server where no GUI is present and only shared printing is desired.</li>
<li>When printing to a SAMBA shared printer (using the CUPS smb: backend, for example).</li>
<li>There is a desire to have the smallest printing system possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most people do <strong>NOT</strong> need to do this.</p>
<p>See the question &quot;How do I install HPIJS only?&quot; for steps on installing a server setup.</p>
<p><strong>Question: What printers and features do you support?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The list of <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/index.html">supported printers</a> and features can be found on the products supported page.</p>
<p><strong>Question: What distributions/operating systems are supported?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Our primary targets are Linux based distributions. We have tested on a variety of Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora Core, SuSE, Mandriva, and Debian, among others. Users have reported success in getting HPLIP to work on Slackware, Gentoo, and other distributions. We currently do not test BSD, UNIX, Solaris, Mac OS X, or Darwin. Other Unix platform may work, but we rely on the community for testing and feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Are you going to provide binaries (RPM, Deb, etc) for my distribution?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Currently these are no plans to provide binaries (RPM, Deb, etc). Binaries are available through the major distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Where can I receive support for HPLIP?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The hplip.sf.net web site is the primary mechanism for HPLIP support. Resources include documentation, FAQs, How-Tos, and mailing lists. Phone support is not available for HPLIP. All documentation is also included in the HPLIP source tar ball.</p>
<p><strong>Question: How do I report a bug (defect) or request a feature?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: You may post bug reports or feature requests to the <a class="reference" href="mailing_lists.html">mailing list</a> .</p>
<p><strong>Question: Is troubleshooting help available for HPLIP?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Please review the How-To's, this FAQ and the other resources on this website for specific troubleshooting information.  Also you can contact the <a class="reference" href="mailing_lists.html">mailing list</a> for addition assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Which types of software licenses apply to HPLIP?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: HPIJS is licensed under the BSD licence. HPLIP is licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses. More information can be found on the <a class="reference" href="license.html">license page</a> and the COPYING file in the source tarball.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Is the source code available?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the source code is available on this website in the <a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=149981">download</a> section.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can HPLIP be used in CUPS?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, HPLIP requires CUPS. HPIJS can be used under CUPS, PDQ, or LPD with foomatic. See <a class="reference" href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html">linuxprinting.org</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Are drivers available for the Deskjet 710C, 712C, 720C, 722C, 820Cse, 820Cxi, 1000Cse, 1000Cxi; or LaserJet 1000, 1005, 1020, 3100; or Color LaserJet 1500, 2600 printers?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: These are non-standard host based printers. Currently there are no plans to support these printers in HPLIP. Ghostscript print filters for the Deskjet products can be found at the <a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa/">pnm2ppa</a> project.</p>
<p><strong>Question: My printer was not listed in the previous question, and is not listed in the product support table. When will a driver be available for my printer?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Our plan is to provide support for new printers as quickly as possible after they are introduced.  Standard support timeframes vary from within 1 week to 1 month.  However support can sometimes take longer than this.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Are HP Designjet printers supported?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No. However, Postscript PPD files are available for several HP DesignJet models.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Are Apollo printers supported?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Printing functionality is only supported.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Are devices with only a parallel port supported?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, they are <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/index.html">supported</a> (with a few <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/unsupported.html">exceptions</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Question: Are HP Photosmart printers supported?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, they are <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/index.html">supported</a> (with a few <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/unsupported.html">exceptions</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Question: Are HP Officejet All-in-ones and MFPs supported?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, they are <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/index.html">supported</a> (with a few <a class="reference" href="supported_devices/unsupported.html">exceptions</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Question: Does HPLIP support HP Scanjet single function scanners?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No, HPLIP only supports devices that include print functionality. For possible Scanjet drivers, visit <a class="reference" href="http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html#Z-HEWLETT-PACKARD">HP SANE Drivers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Does HPLIP support networked printers?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, HPLIP supports printers that are directly network connected (via a built-in Ethernet port) or connected to a network via a JetDirect.</p>
<p><strong>Question:  Does HPLIP support a SAMBA setup/configuration?</strong></p>
<p>Printers that are shared via a Windows share and SAMBA are not supported (you can however, print to devices shared with SAMBA using CUPS with the smb: backend). Printers that are shared via CUPS from another Linux PC on a network are supported by HPLIP.  However printing only will work--extended functionality such as scanning, photo card and status will not.</p>
<p><strong>Question: When using HPLIP for scanning, what program should I use?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: HPLIP should support all SANE front-end applications. We have tested scanning with xsane, xscanimage, and kooka. The scanadf application is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Is faxing from the PC functionality available in HPLIP?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, as of version 0.9.8, basic PC send fax functionality is supported on a number of printers.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Does HP offer solutions for customers who would like to print enable their applications and devices not based on the Linux Desktop?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. HP has developed the <a class="reference" href="http://www.hpdevelopersolutions.com/apdk.cfm">Appliance Printing Development Kit (APDK)</a>. The APDK is a small footprint limited functionality driver intended for Non-Linux Desktop applications and devices.</p>
<p><strong>Question:  How do I install HPIJS only?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:  Use the following example instructions to install HPIJS only. Note, you must build/install from the &quot;prnt/hpijs&quot; directory <strong>not</strong> the top level directory.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
tar xzvf hpip-0.9.10.tar.gz
cd hplip-0.9.10/prnt/hpijs
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install
</pre>
<p>You can also use the installer to install only HPIJS if you use &quot;custom&quot; mode (ie, not &quot;automatic&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>Question:  I need/lost the driver for my Windows machine, where do I go to get it?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:  The HPLIP Team only provides support for the HPLIP solution.  For assistance with a Windows machine/driver please contact the HP Technical Support at <a class="reference" href="http://www.hp.com">HP</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Question:  What network print servers are supported?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:  Currently we have only tested HP JetDirect devices with HPLIP. No other network print servers are supported.</p>
<p><strong>Question:  How can I configure my MS Windows system to share my printer to my Linux system?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:  This configuration is not currently supported.</p>
